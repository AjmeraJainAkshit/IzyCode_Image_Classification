Cat vs. Dog Image Classification with SVM
This repository implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset ([link to dataset]). The project emphasizes data preparation, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization (optional).

Project Goal
The objective is to build a model that accurately distinguishes between cat and dog images using machine learning techniques. This model can be used for various applications, such as image tagging and content filtering.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is not included in this repository due to potential licensing restrictions. However, you can access the dataset by clicking the following link (replace with actual link): [link to dataset]

Please note: Depending on the dataset source, you may need to download and pre-process the data before using it with this code.

Methodology
Data Preparation:

Download the dataset from the provided link.
Pre-process the data by:
Resizing images to a consistent size.
Converting images to a suitable format (e.g., grayscale).
Handling missing values (if any).
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction:

Extract relevant features from the images. Common techniques include:
Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features
Model Training:

Train an SVM model with the extracted features and corresponding labels (cat or dog).
Experiment with different SVM parameters (e.g., kernel function, regularization) to optimize performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze the results and identify areas for improvement (if needed).
(Optional) Visualization:

Visualize the decision boundary of the SVM model, which represents the separation hyperplane between cat and dog classes in the feature space.
Technologies and Tools
This project primarily relies on:

Python (programming language)
Scikit-learn (machine learning library for SVM implementation)
OpenCV (optional: for image processing)
Matplotlib (optional: for visualization)
Getting Started
The repository includes detailed instructions and code examples in separate files. These guides will cover:

Setting up the environment and installing necessary libraries.
Downloading and pre-processing the dataset.
Implementing feature extraction techniques.
Training and evaluating the SVM model.
(Optional) Visualizing the decision boundary.
